This Repo doesn't include the Binary File called 'cosine_similarity_model' (imported and used in main.py using pickle for making predictions) because of the size limitation. Please refer to my other repo of Content-Based Filtering (https://github.com/RaffayHusayn/Content-Based-Filtering) to see how to save it using pickle.
